## Introduction
  
Here i used c language for code. I used array data structure in this code. First we'll take two names of persons and stored in arrays and cancelled the letters that
are present in both names and maintained count for it and then this count is ittrated through the word ‘flames’. For doing the code i have used standard I/O functions, library functions, string functions, switch cases, loops, conditions etc.

## About the FLAMES GAME
  •The relationship game is nothing but a flames game which we have played during the school age. It's all based on NAMES.
  
  •Here we take two names and delete the letters that are common in both names and count the length of both strings (after removing the similar letters) and
    Count through the letters of ‘flames’ Move through the letters in the word "FLAMES" one at a time until your count reaches the total number of leftover letters
    that you found previously.
    
  •Note your ending letter. Whichever letter you end on will provide you the answer for the kind of relationship you can look forward to with the person
      whose name you are using.
## Advantages
   •With the c program of this we can get the relationship between the 2 persons faster and accurately.
  
   • Even for larger names we can find the relationship in fraction of seconds.
   
   • Improves the coding skills.
   
   • Also improves our logical thinking.
## Disadvantages
  •The relation between the two persons may not be real it’s just based on given condition.
  
  •Sometimes the results might mislead to problems, so don't take them seriously.
